---------------------------------------

Solver code is located in the src directory.
Each problem is located in a subdirectory of the problems directory.

To model a problem, you need to extend the Model class. 
See examples in the problems directory. Further documentation on each
problem is given in the README files in the problem directory.

To modify the solver, you need to change the code in the src directory.
